# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify spam emails effectively. It uses a variety of techniques to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) based on their content and features.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text data
- Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, etc.
- Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance
- Real-time prediction capability for user-provided emails

## Requirements
The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this project repository to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd email-spam-detection
   ```
3. **Open the Notebook**:  
   Start Jupyter Notebook and open `Email spam detection.ipynb`.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Run the Notebook**:  
   Execute the cells in sequence to preprocess the data, train models, and make predictions.

## Data
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project should contain labeled email data with columns like `label` (spam/ham) and `text` (email content).
- **Custom Data**: You can replace the dataset with your own data by placing the file in the project directory and updating the file path in the notebook.

## Output
The notebook generates:
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix and visualizations
- Saved model files (if implemented)
